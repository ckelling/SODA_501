# SODA_501 Project

## Project Description:
For our group project for SODA 501, we will be analyzing a dataset of geo-tagged tweets
from Twitter. The time window for these tweets is December 16-31, 2015. Overall, this
dataset has over 4.8 million geo-tagged tweets and is stored in JSON format. Since this
dataset is collected over the holiday season, we are interested in conducting a spatial
analysis of holiday travel patterns. Investigating this data will reveal important patterns
about travel and can illuminate some clusters of origin and destinations. For example, we
are interested to see if we can see if the population of a college town is leaving the college
town during this time period. This analysis will have many challenges. First, we will have
to distinguish tweets from organizations/campaigns/celebrities from individuals. We will
have to identify tweets from which we can infer potential travel. This will be accomplished
by ltering individuals who made a minimum of two tweets in two distinct places to
illustrate that they have traveled. This will be followed by further understanding the
the content of tweets and how they relate to their travel. We then can develop questions
about what people are saying in these tweets, perhaps relating to where they are traveling.

## Contents:
* src: includes all code for this project
* output: includes all output from my code for this class, including images and some reports

There are individual ReadMe files in each of the src and output folders. 
* The src ReadMe gives details about the purpose of each code file.
* The ouput ReadMe shows where each image/document was created, and a brief description.
