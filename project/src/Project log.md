#Week of Feb 19
##Shipi - Humanizr 
Install.sh working, but classifer not running because of setup issues. We have now decided to change direction. We will now subset the dataset to number of tweets from college towns. This will make the twitter dataset manageable. Currently the dataset is 13.4 GB. 

# Week Feb 26:
## Xiaoran:
* write codes for selecting tweets in the ten college towns that Shipi suggested 
* https://www.citylab.com/equity/2016/09/americas-biggest-college-towns/498755/
## Claire:
* run codes to select the college towns 
(or can just show Xiaoran how to run codes on Penn State Cluster, i.e., running R codes on Terminal)
* based on the selected tweets, write codes for selecting other tweets that came from the same Twitter users 
(maybe Shipi and So Young can help with this!)
