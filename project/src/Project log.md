This file is to keep track of our progress and tasks ever week.

#Week of Feb 19
##Shipi - Humanizr 
Install.sh working, but classifer not running because of setup issues. We have now decided to change direction. We will now subset the dataset to number of tweets from college towns. This will make the twitter dataset manageable. Currently the dataset is 13.4 GB. 

# Week Feb 26:
## Xiaoran:
* write codes for selecting tweets in the ten college towns that Shipi suggested 
* https://www.citylab.com/equity/2016/09/americas-biggest-college-towns/498755/
## Claire:
* run codes to select the college towns 
(or can just show Xiaoran how to run codes on Penn State Cluster, i.e., running R codes on Terminal)
* based on the selected tweets, write codes for selecting other tweets that came from the same Twitter users 
(maybe Shipi and So Young can help with this!)

# Week March 15:
## Burt's comments:
* What is the population that we want to focus on?
* Why college towns? Why not using the whole dataset?
## Things we may need to discuss:
* Do we still want to keep the college towns direction? If so, we may want to identify the students Twitter users using, for example, the profile information of the users.
* Or do we want to take a step back and look at ALL of the data? We can downsize the data by subsetting the VARIABLES (instead of users). For example, we just need the tweet id, the user id, the location and coordinates of the tweets (and maybe also the followers & friends count, the content of the tweet, the user profile to identify non-human vs. human users).
* For reference: college by enrollment - https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=74

## After discussion during the class break:
* We may be able to stick to the college town data. What we need to do is to provide stronger rationale for doing that.
* We can also peform same prodecure to the big city users. And compare the flow for college towns to that of big cities.
* (also random thoughts by Xiaoran) Maybe we can just conduct analysis on people traveling IN and OUT of the towns and cities. See what the directions of the flow are during holiday season. For example, I'm interested in the question: Do people tend to travel into or out of college towns? When are the in- and out-flow tend to happen (pre- or post-Christmas)? Maybe we will get different answers for the college towns and the big cities.
