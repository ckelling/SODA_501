Claire:
- run codes to select the college towns (or can just show Xiaoran how to run codes on Penn State Cluster, i.e., running R codes on Terminal)
- based on the selected tweets, write codes for selecting other tweets that came from the same Twitter users (maybe Shipi and So Young can help with this!)
